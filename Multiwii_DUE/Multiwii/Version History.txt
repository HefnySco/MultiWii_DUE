Version Control



version 0.0.1.0: 
Date:  11 May 2014
Description: still under construction ... code compile, but not complete on DUE.


version 0.0.1.1: 
Date:  12 May 2014
Description: still under construction ... code compile, EPROM is working now.

version 0.0.1.2
Date: 13 May 2014
Description" still under construction.... solved a big issue in EEPROM related to paging.


version 0.0.1.3
Date: 15 May 2014
Description: still under construction... RX signal for the first 5 channels are working now.
known issue: The Gyro factor GYR_CMPF_FACTOR has to be 2 for proper reading, which suggest another data conversion issue. The first issue in gyro was in the raw data and has been solved by adding strong typing integer16 in casting.


version 0.0.1.4
Date: 16 May 2014
Description: still under construction... Quad & TRI configuration is working now :)
known issue: The Gyro factor GYR_CMPF_FACTOR has to be 2 for proper reading, which suggest another data conversion issue. The first issue in gyro was in the raw data and has been solved by adding strong typing integer16 in casting.


version 0.0.1.5
Date: 17 May 2014
Description: still under construction... Quad & TRI configuration is working now :)
known issue: The Gyro factor GYR_CMPF_FACTOR has to be 2 for proper reading, which suggest another data conversion issue. The first issue in gyro was in the raw data and has been solved by adding strong typing integer16 in casting.
enhancement: calling wire_due has been optimized by data types to avoid unnecessary intermediate functions. execution time is no 1.4ms rather than 4+ms

version 0.0.1.6
Date 19 May 2014
Description: major communication issue has been discovered and solved... related to 32-bit data alignment.
known issue: Gyro issue .... getting close to solve it


version 0.0.1.7
Date 20 May 2014
Description: Gyro issue has been solved AT LAST :) 
The issue was due to the cycle time that is used to calculate deltaGyro was uint16_t
it should be int32_t as in the main cycle of the Multiwii.cpp
uint16_t currentT = micros();
anyhow I added a #if define to allow this type of change.


version 0.0.1.8
Date 20 May 2014
Description: You can fly using QuadP,X & TRI

version 0.0.1.9
Date 29 May 2014
Description: Fix TWI resulted in compile problem on AVR.
