version 0.0.1.0: 
Date:  11 May 2014
Description: still under construction ... code compile, but not complete on DUE.


version 0.0.1.1: 
Date:  12 May 2014
Description: still under construction ... code compile, EPROM is working now.

version 0.0.1.2
Date: 13 May 2014
Description" still under construction.... solved a big issue in EEPROM related to paging.


version 0.0.1.3
Date: 15 May 2014
Description: still under construction... RX signal for the first 5 channels are working now.
known issue: The Gyro factor GYR_CMPF_FACTOR has to be 2 for proper reading, which suggest another data conversion issue. The first issue in gyro was in the raw data and has been solved by adding strong typing integer16 in casting.


version 0.0.1.4
Date: 16 May 2014
Description: still under construction... Quad & TRI configuration is working now :)
known issue: The Gyro factor GYR_CMPF_FACTOR has to be 2 for proper reading, which suggest another data conversion issue. The first issue in gyro was in the raw data and has been solved by adding strong typing integer16 in casting.


version 0.0.1.5
Date: 17 May 2014
Description: still under construction... Quad & TRI configuration is working now :)
known issue: The Gyro factor GYR_CMPF_FACTOR has to be 2 for proper reading, which suggest another data conversion issue. The first issue in gyro was in the raw data and has been solved by adding strong typing integer16 in casting.
enhancement: calling wire_due has been optimized by data types to avoid unnecessary intermediate functions. execution time is no 1.4ms rather than 4+ms
