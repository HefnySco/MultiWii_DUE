 BARO LAMP
 1- baro mode never enterd
 2- either never set
 3- st.flag             = tmp; even when tmp =0 still the lamp turns on.
 4- When adjusting "RC Control Setting with SUX=H => BARO ... Debug variables worked correclty however:
	1- I could not see BARO lamp working properly
	2- when saving the settings the GUI said the response was wrong.
	3- with version 2.3 I get error in ability to ARM, although the same everything arms in version 2.2
	
	
	1- I changed the TX buffer size ... still not working !!!
	now I am sure it is a protocol issue, but dont  know WHY.
	2- Even when st.flag=0 still BARO is highlighted
	
	ISSUE is DATA ALIGNMENT .... solved from: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=78026.0
